## Inspiration
I've been playing Clash Royale ever since it was released. A few years ago they changed the sound of the King's reactions and limited to one each. I came a doing Sudokus for as long as I can remember. I've based this project off of the Sudoku book I've had for over 10 years and Sudoku.com.  

## Process
* Came across a video with the [old King sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpUmrDnELws) !
* Saved the video and clipped out each individual sound effect.
* Started the project. Assigned the grouped sound effects to a button e.g Happy, Sad, Laughing and Angry.
* Randomised the sound effect on each button click and replaced the buttons with images. Learnt how to replace buttons with images [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16131988/making-an-image-act-like-a-button)
* Imported the font **You Blockhead**, which is the Clash font. I had a few issues with this, so the following are the resources I used:
  - [Custom Fonts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35718750/adding-custom-fonts-to-github-pages)
  - [Using installed fonts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15195315/css-using-installed-fonts)
* All of the above done on (_23/08/2021_)

## Features
* Random reaction each click
* Easy to navigate page
* Simple layout
* Authentic Clash Font

To-do list:
* There may be more old sounds, so adding those

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
